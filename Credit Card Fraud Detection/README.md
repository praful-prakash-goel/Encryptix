# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies, the model aims to accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and preparing the transaction data for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Training: Using supervised learning algorithms to train the model on historical transaction data.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Implementing the model to monitor and flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
